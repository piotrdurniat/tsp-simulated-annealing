# Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem

This project is a C++ implementation of the Simulated annealing algorithm for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is an optimization problem of finding the minimum Hamiltonian cycle in a complete weighted graph.

## Build the project

Run:

```bash
make
```

## Define the algorithm settings:

- To change the algorithm settings, edit the [`settings.ini`](settings.ini) file.
- The settings file defines basic parameters of the algorithm as well as the instances which will be used by the algorithm.
- Example instance files are located in the [`instances`](instances) directory
- Instance files define the graphs on which the algorithm will be called. They can have two extensions:
  - `.tsp` for undirected graphs (e.g. [`gr17.tsp`](instances/gr17.tsp))
  - `.atsp` for directed graphs (e.g. [`m6.atsp`](instances/m6.atsp))

## Run the algorithm:

Run:

```bash
./bin/main
```

The results will be saved as `.csv` files in the directory specified in the `settings.ini` file.

## Filtering out 'outliers' from the results

You can remove outlying results by running the `rm_outlier.py` script.
(files from which outliers should be removed are wonderfully hard-coded in the script)

```bash
python3 rm_outliers
```

## Measure RAM usage over time:

```bash
./valgrind-mem.sh <massif_out_file> <csv_out_file>

```

example:

```bash
./valgrind-mem.sh massif.out mem.csv

```

### Ms print

```bash
ms_print <out_file>
```

## Get max RAM usage

Read "Maximum resident set size (kbytes)" value from:

```bash
/usr/bin/time -v ./bin/main
```
